### General Data Science
- Smart-bins from input data
  - Implement this <https://8080labs.com/blog/posts/find-best-bins-for-plotly-histogram/>

### pandas

- did you mean `.value_counts()` ?
- Styling preset
- The pandas SQLDatabase and SQLiteDatabase caching patches still try to connect to DB before accessing the
  cache this is probably happening during instantiation of the class. This makes the caching unusable when
  unconnected to the internet.

## Bugs

- FileExistsError when a method is patched multiple times.
  The solution is to create a registry for patched methods
  such that we don't double-patch methods.
